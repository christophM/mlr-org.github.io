shiny-mlr is a GUI built with the shiny R-package that wraps mlr into a web
app.

[Stefan](http://Coorsaa.github.io/) and [me](http://florianfendt.github.io/)
started working on this project late summer 2016 as part of a practical
course we attended for our Master's program. We enjoyed the work on this
project and will continue to maintain our app in the future. Today,
we are happy to present our app in this blog-post. We will show you the
workflow and main features of our app with the aid of the titanic
competition from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
So let's get into it: <br/>

When running our app, the first thing you will see is the import screen.
This is the place to import your data. You can simply use one of mlr's
integrated toy-datasets, upload CSV or ARFF files from your machine,
or use a dataset from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org). I want to have
a deeper look into this feature, because the OpenML integration
is unique to mlr:

You can browse all datasets that are stored on OpenML's servers and import
the dataset by simply clicking the corresponding row of the datatable:

Once you imported your data you can inspect and modify it in the "data" section:

Let's first look at the summary panel. You have a datatable at the top
which gives you a quick summary of your variables. Selecting a row in
the datatable, results in a plot that visualizes the variable's distribution:

You also have the option to select multiple rows to get a
correlation-plot matrix:

The second subsection, enables you to process your data. We included a lot of
methods to fulfill your preprocessing needs (hopefully ;)). Not all the
options you can select here are not mlr-specific. You can drop variables,
recode factor levels, subset your data and much more. Methods that use built-in
mlr functions are impute, capLargeValues and createDummyFeatures.

In the next section you finally construct your task. Choose a variable and
create the task. Depending on the targets encoding the app will
automatically create a classifiaction or regression task, respectively.
If your dataset contains a variable for the observation weights, you can
also select it here (This variable will then be dropped from the task's data).
