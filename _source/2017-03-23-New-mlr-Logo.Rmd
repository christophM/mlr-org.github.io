We at mlr are currently deciding on a new logo, and in the spirit of open-source, we would like to involve the community in the voting process!

You can vote for your favorite logo on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/issues/1684) by reacting to the logo with a +1.

Thanks to [Hannah Atkin](https://dribbble.com/hratkin) for designing the logos!
