The [`mlr`: Machine Learning in R](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-066.html) package provides a generic, object-oriented and extensible framework for classification, regression, survival analysis and clustering for the statistical programming language R. 
The package targets practitioners who want to quickly apply machine learning algorithms, as well as researchers who want to implement, benchmark, and compare their new methods in a structured environment.

We are happy to announce that we now offer training courses specialized on [`mlr`: Machine Learning in R](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-066.html):

- A 3-day course "Machine Learning and Data Mining in R" is already taught by the  [Munich R Courses](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/einfuehrung-maschinelles-lernen/) focusing on the [`mlr` package](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) itself with a quick introduction to theoretical concepts of machine learning. 
Save the date! The next course starts on 2nd of May 2018 (in German) at [Munich R Courses](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/kurs/machine-learning/).

- We also give R inhouse courses in English or German. 
Send your request through the form [here.](http://www.muenchner-r-kurse.de/inhouse-schulungen/)
- If you offer R or Data Science courses and want to include a course on [`mlr`: Machine Learning in R](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-066.html) in your course program, feel free to contact us at [rkurse@stat.uni-muenchen.de](rkurse@stat.uni-muenchen.de).
- A short introduction to `mlr` is also given at the  [Professional Certificate Program "Data Science"](http://www.datascience-certificate.de) which is a brand new extra-occupational 10-day training at LMU starting in May 2018. The application deadline for the certificate course is 15 March 2018.
